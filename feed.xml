Last time, it took me a lot of more time to digest what the questions were asking and then understand how I could even decide the answer. I understood the majority of the topics on this quiz almost after a minute or two with multiple reads. From the last multiple choice, I feel like I have actually learned a lot more, even if it is the most basic knowledge. Before this quiz I was really discouraged about my progress and felt like I have not really learned much or made any progress, but from my results and the way I got through this quiz, I think I am on track so far in APCSP." ] } ], "metadata": { "kernelspec": { "display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3" }, "language_info": { "name": "python", "version": "3.10.6 (tags/v3.10.6:9c7b4bd, Aug 1 2022, 21:53:49) [MSC v.1932 64 bit (AMD64)]" }, "orig_nbformat": 4, "vscode": { "interpreter": { "hash": "dcd4837add793386cd67e25a441830de5b4a5ceabdd5dcba5a317ceae751db5e" } } }, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2 }]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">MC Practice Results</title><link href="https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/2023/01/31/APCSPCollageBoardtest.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MC Practice Results" /><published>2023-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/2023/01/31/APCSPCollageBoardtest</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First Notebook</title><link href="https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/newcode/week%200/2023/01/30/_Notebook.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Notebook" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/newcode/week%200/2023/01/30/_Notebook</id><author><name>Caleb Navarro</name></author><category term="Newcode" /><category term="Week 0" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello People on the internet week 0 project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 1 Questions</title><link href="https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/newcode/week%201/2023/01/30/_questions.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 1 Questions" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/newcode/week%201/2023/01/30/_questions</id><author><name>Caleb Navarro</name></author><category term="Newcode" /><category term="Week 1" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 1 project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lists and Dictionary</title><link href="https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/newcode/week%202/2023/01/30/_Lists.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lists and Dictionary" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cubnavarro.github.io/Firstproject/newcode/week%202/2023/01/30/_Lists</id><author><name>Caleb Navarro</name></author><category term="Newcode" /><category term="Week 2" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
