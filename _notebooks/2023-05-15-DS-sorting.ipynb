    "    - Is a list and/or dictionary in python considered a primitive or collection type?  Why? \n",
    "A list and a dictionary in Python are considered collection types rather than primitive types. Primitive types are fundamental data types provided by the programming language itself, such as integers and booleans. In contrast, lists and dictionaries are dynamic and flexible data structures that can hold multiple values or objects. A list is an ordered collection of elements, while a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. They both allow for efficient manipulation and retrieval of data, making them valuable tools for organizing and representing information in Python.\n",
    "    - Is the list passed into bubble sort \"pass-by-value\" or \"pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output. - \n",
    "In Python, the list passed into the bubble sort algorithm is passed by reference, not by value. This means that any modifications made to the list within the algorithm directly affect the original list. As bubble sort involves swapping elements within the list, these modifications are applied to the original list. The output of the algorithm reflects these changes, as it operates on the list in place. This behavior aligns with Python's default approach for mutable objects, allowing for efficient memory usage and direct modifications to the original data structure.\n",
