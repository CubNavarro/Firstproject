<h2 id="Overview-of-the-Test">Overview of the Test<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview-of-the-Test"> </a></h2><p>The test was not to bad overall and I didn't have that bad of a time doing the test. After i did the test I looked over some of the questions that I got wrong and some of them were not reading the whole answer and simple mistake but others were actual mistakes and didn't understand/know what or how to do the question. The whole test took me about 1 hour and allowed me to really get an understnanding of what I need to learn and know for the Ap test</p>

<h3 id="Question-6">Question 6<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-6"> </a></h3><p><img src="/Firstproject/images/copied_from_nb/CSPquestion6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I had no clue what this was and I really guessed for this question because I really didn't know how to find the answer for this and will have to look at more of these and kinda study this question to make sure I get it correct on the AP test</p>
<h3 id="Question-18">Question 18<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-18"> </a></h3><p><img src="/Firstproject/images/copied_from_nb/CSPquestion18.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This question i went though it way to fast and read the question wrong and this one was also pretty simple but I did get this one wrong and I need to make sure i don't make mistakes in the future</p>
<h3 id="Question-21">Question 21<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-21"> </a></h3><p><img src="/Firstproject/images/copied_from_nb/CSPquestion21.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was another one of the simple mistake that I did though the test and this one was super easy looking back at the question and I am kinda mad at myself that I didn't do better and get the answer correct because this was a very short sequence and not that complex.</p>
<h3 id="Question-36">Question 36<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-36"> </a></h3><p><img src="/Firstproject/images/copied_from_nb/CSPquestion36.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This question was pretty hard for me and I had a challenging time with this question, it probally took me around 10 minutes to try and understand this question and what was happening and I though that I got itcorrect and figured it out but it wasn't correct and I got it wrong</p>
<h3 id="Question-39">Question 39<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-39"> </a></h3><p><img src="/Firstproject/images/copied_from_nb/CSPquestion39.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This question was not hard for me and I really understood how to do it I just made a simple mistake and feel really stupid because the robot questions are really easy for me and I have a good understanding of this question I just need to slow down and take my time in order to read the question correct and get the right answer</p>
