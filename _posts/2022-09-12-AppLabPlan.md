## Code.org Quiz

[Quiz](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/mamf5GOpCska7gBaMDDQyE0mIWnglq4P5oPT-H8LtK4)

## Subject

I really didn't have a plan or Subject for the Quiz and just did a bunch od random Questions.

## Questions

1. Who is this?
2. Who is this?
3. What Logo is this?

## Coding

I mainly used the onEvent block to signify when a button was clicked it would tell you if the answer was right or the quesrtion was correct. I used comments to split up code and signify which parts for which of the quiz.
