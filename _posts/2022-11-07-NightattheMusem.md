# Photos From Night at the Museum

I took images from the differnet class projects that I looked at during the night. I looked at some of the 3D Animation work along with ceramics and Drawing and painting. I stayed for about an hour 30 minutes in APCSP and 30 minutes looking around at the work of classmates and friends.
