## Collaboration Quiz
> Score: 3 out of 3
This quiz was not a big challenge with me and I did not have much of a or any challenge with these question.

## Program Function and Purpose Quiz
> Score: 4/6
This quiz confused me a little and thought I was following the diagrams in questions 1 and 2 but ended up not and geting those wrong. Although I did understand the rest of the quizzes and did get the last 4 correct. I feel like the diagrams are a little weird and can be hard to follow.

## Program Design and Development Quiz
> Score: 1/3
This quiz was tricky because I know that I understand it and still the diagrams are a little tricky but I did not get the mark that. This was good and bad overall.
