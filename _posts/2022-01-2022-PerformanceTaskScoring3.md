|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|College Board gave the point due to the fact all was correct|
|Data Abstraction|0|0| Collegeboard didnt they diddnt acsess data from the list so there was no storage.|
|Managing Complexity|0|0| They didnt give a point as the data could have been used within a list and conditional|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|0| Only one parameter set which didnt serve purpose for code which didnt meet requirements for as it was stated to move the process smoothly|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1| 	Had an if statement known as RPS which meant that |
|Testing|1|1| The app was tested very well and it included all parts of testing for the app|

|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|	Video had a clear input and output which is required also purpose is clear in the written explanation. As it is to serve as entertainment for the user|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|The response shows how data is store in order to itterate the list of letofguessword which stores data and is acsess througout the code.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1| It used the game for the user to guess the word and kept a data storage which made it simple|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|Guess word parameter was usen giving it a 1|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1| Repeated loop with replace list meeting the criteria. Also used booleans to check true or false in order to keep word accuracy|
|Testing|1|1|The word guessser was very good and all part were correct|

|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|Video had a clear input and output which is required also the response contained clear funtion/purpose.|
|Data Abstraction|0|0|A list was made but data storage wasnt used|
|Managing Complexity|0|0|it doesent talk about managing complexity as it only talks about using a list|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|0|No parameters were used with left there no procedures|
|Algorithm Implementation|0|0|They use update screen however no other algorthms were used leaving the code to be pointless|
|Testing|0|0|The app was tested very well and it included all parts of testing for the app the point|

|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|Purpose and fucntion were defined correclty and inputs and outputs were shown with the use of moving keys to fish|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|uses a list called fish types which show how data is stored leaving to be kept in one area with distinct characteristics|
|Managing Complexity|1|1|the data and code used a list of lists to keep everthing simple rather than using multiple lists and procedures|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|had clone movement parameter which kept everything runnig and with procedures|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|An algorithm for height and movement for set keeping game moving which met all criteria|
|Testing|1|1|explanation differs from the code and parameters set which doesent meet criteria|
