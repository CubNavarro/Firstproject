## things to Consider

### Copying other Apps

I have to make my game different enough from other games but simular in a way that makes it really cool to play bringing in people and customers to make money to keep creating and expanding the game.

### Plagiarism

Not to just make an exact copy of a game this will just look bad and can get sued and will not be your own game
