|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|Program has both an input and output. It describes it's purpose as finding information about a triangle and its function as showing the triangle ratios of a triangle that has been inputed.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1| Has a code segment that shows the arithmetic that calculates the triangle ratios. Shows a list. Has name of variables and describes the data in the list.|
|Managing Complexity|0|0| Has code segment shoring the complexity but doesn't explain it. They just gave another piece of code.|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|1| Has code segment showing the student-developed procedure and has parameter and shows where the SDP is being called. Finally describes the functionality of the program well.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1| Has code segment showing the student-developed procedure and has parameter and shows where the SDP is being called. Finally describes the functionality of the program well.|

|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|Met all the criteria for this section. Has input and output and describes the function and purpose. The function is placing blocks that move and the purpose is entertainment.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1| Met all the criteria for this section. Has proper code segments explaining how data is stored and remebered from the users input. The blocks moving. It does fulfill the purpose. Shoes name of variable and describes what the data is contained in.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1| Has code segment showing a list and explains how it could be different.|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|1| This response describes the code segment but it never had a clear code segment depicted that showed the student developed procedure with 1+ parameter or SDP being called.|
|Algorithm Implementation|0|1| Has sequencing and selection but doesn't have iteration and doesn't explain.|
