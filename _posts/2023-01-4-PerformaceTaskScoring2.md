# Student 3
|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|------------------------|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0| Because they did not describe the code's functionality|
|Data Abstraction|1|0|Because the student included a list that was needed for college board. |
|Managing Complexity|0|0| Because the student did not show complexity within their submission. |
|Procedural Abstraction|0|0|because there was no proof that there would be contributions to functionality. |
|Algorithm Implementation|0|0| as there was no evidence of how a student could recreate the code. |
|Testing|1|1| as the student showed responses, showed multiple forms of calling data, and met all criteria.|

# Student 4
|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|------------------------|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|1| as the student demonstrated inputs, functionality, and outputs. |
|Data Abstraction|1|1| as the student showed how the data represents a program.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1| the student shows how they were able to manage complexity within code.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1| student gave a detailed description of their code and how it contributed to the functionality of the program.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|Student demonstrated sequences,  selections, and iterations|
|Testing|1|1| Student was able to show two different calls.|

# Student 5
|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|------------------------|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|The student did not really show a purpose for the code. |
|Data Abstraction|0|1|I think that the code of a list was outside the loop so it does not earn the point for collegeboard |
|Managing Complexity|1|1| As the student met all expectations by adding lists and going into detail on how it was able to make the code less complex.|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|1| As there was a description of functionality and how the code benefits it.|
|Algorithm Implementation|0|1|the student described how people would be able to manipulate the code and recreate it. |
|Testing|0|1|  I think that the code is too similar and collegeboard wants distinct calls in two different ways.|

# Student 6
|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|------------------------|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|All criteria was met and the purpose of the program was shown. |
|Data Abstraction|0|0| Because some of the data that is collected was not actually used.|
|Managing Complexity|1|0| because the student showed lists and details.|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|1| As the student showed how abstracting the data contributed to the code.|
|Algorithm Implementation|0|1| As the student was able to show all three criteria in the code and write up: sequencing, selecting and iterating.|
|Testing|1|0| Because the student showed 2 calls and met all criteria.|
