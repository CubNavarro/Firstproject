## Overview of the Test

I got a 19 out of 25 on the Big Idea Quiz and this quiz took me about half of the period. This quiz was not that bad as I understood most of the information because some of the question were select all that apply and I got 1 out of the two correct and knew the information just not all. I did ask for help on some of the questions to my group members and they helped me solve the problem and get the correct answer on some of the questions

## Final Score

### Question 12

This question was pretty hard for me and I didn't really understand the question. For this Question I really guessed on the question because I didn't know and when I asked my group for this question they didn't know too

### Question 15
