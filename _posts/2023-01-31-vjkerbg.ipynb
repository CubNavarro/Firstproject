    "I got a 45 out of 50 on the final, which was a higher score than I expected to get. I will be going over the questions that I got wrong and attempt corrections, as well as discussing how I felt about the test.\n",

    "## Reflection:\n",
    "Overall, I think I did great on this multiple choice quiz. Last time, it took me a lot of more time to digest what the questions were asking and then understand how I could even decide the answer. I understood the majority of the topics on this quiz almost after a minute or two with multiple reads. From the last multiple choice, I feel like I have actually learned a lot more, even if it is the most basic knowledge. Before this quiz I was really discouraged about my progress and felt like I have not really learned much or made any progress, but from my results and the way I got through this quiz, I think I am on track so far in APCSP."
