<blockquote>
  <p>Score: 4/6
This quiz confused me a little and thought I was following the diagrams in questions 1 and 2 but ended up not and geting those wrong. Although I did understand the rest of the quizzes and did get the last 4 correct. I feel like the diagrams are a little weird and can be hard to follow.</p>

  <p>Score: 1/3
This quiz was tricky because I know that I understand it and still the diagrams are a little tricky but I did not get the mark that. This was good and bad overall.</p>

<p>This Quiz had ups and downs though out the whole thing some question were hard and others were easy but under are some notes and things I bloged about whil I took the quiz and After.</p>

<p>Question 16 was about Internet and sending things over the internet and how mesages are broken into packages.</p>

<p><img src="/Firstproject/images/Question16.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Question 17 was pretty difficult for me and my group members helped explain the answer and how to get it and really helped me though the quiz.</p>

<p><img src="/Firstproject/images/Question17.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Question 19 - 22 was a about Binary numbers and I really had a challenging time and was hard for me to understand them.</p>

<p><img src="/Firstproject/images/Question19.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/Firstproject/images/Question22.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Question 24 was more binary numbers and need help from my group. It looked easy but when I really though about it it was complex and relized how it worked.</p>

<p><img src="/Firstproject/images/Question24.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Question 39 was simple but I over though it and put hello as my orinal answer then changed it to 4 because I saw “a Valid Index for the list”.</p>
