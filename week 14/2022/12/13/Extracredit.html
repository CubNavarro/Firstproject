<p>Interviews are challenging and they are timed tests to see your skills and showing that you now your stuff and have a good understanding of the job you are trying to join. There are some challenges where the companies are smooter and 40 hours and less deadlines and other companies with more coding and faster quicker dead lines. The type of jobs is all up to the person that is working and what you want to do.</p>
